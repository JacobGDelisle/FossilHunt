Intro
-
Fossil Hunt is an educational web game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project was created via Visual Studio and published via Netlify.

This was an internship project that spanned over the course of one college semester, and was made in close collaboration with a local library for a reading program.

The purpose of the game is to find and assemble fossil pieces in order to fill up a museum. 


Function
-
The game features four levels, each level containing three randomized puzzles followed by one final puzzle to piece together the fossils.
Once a level is complete, a fact for the assembled fossil is shown.


Puzzle Types:

Money Puzzles
Wire Connection
Math Quizzes
Science Quizzes

These puzzles change based on a difficulty system. At the start of the game the user selects their grade from four options.


An example of the change in difficulty:
Money Puzzle:

K-1st: Counting Pennies
7th-8th: Determining the payment needed for buying X amount of a random item that costs Y each, with tax and a possible discount.


The fossil construction puzzle utilizes drag and drop with outlined zones on the screen.
